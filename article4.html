    <p><strong>2. Soil First</strong><br>
    Great gardening begins with nutrient-rich soil. Test and amend your soil for optimal results.</p>
    
    <p><strong>3. Tailor Your Vegetable Choices</strong><br>
    Grow vegetables suited to your experience and season. Diversify your garden with a mix of fast-growing and staple crops.</p>
    
    <p><strong>4. Plan and Rotate</strong><br>
    Strategically plan your layout and rotate crops to prevent nutrient depletion and pest buildup.</p>
