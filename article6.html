    <h1>Urban Gardening: Growing Vegetables in the City</h1>
    <p>Urban living doesn’t mean giving up on fresh vegetables. Use these tips to create a thriving city garden:</p>
    
    <p><strong>1. Find the Sun</strong><br>
    Locate a sunny area, whether it’s a balcony, rooftop, or small yard. Sunlight is crucial for vegetable growth.</p>
    
    <p><strong>2. Enrich Your Soil</strong><br>
    Urban soils may need extra care. Test and amend your soil, or consider raised beds with fresh compost.</p>
    
    <p><strong>3. Choose Compact Crops</strong><br>
    Opt for space-efficient vegetables like cherry tomatoes or lettuce. Pick varieties suited for containers if necessary.</p>
    
    <p><strong>4. Smart Layout Planning</strong><br>
    Utilize vertical space with trellises and keep smaller plants at the forefront. Rotate crops to maintain soil health.</p>
    
    <p><strong>5. Efficient Watering</strong><br>
    Urban gardens often dry out quickly. Water deeply and consistently, preferably early in the morning.</p>
    
    <p><strong>6. Mulch for Urban Heat</strong><br>
    Mulch helps mitigate the heat island effect and retains precious moisture.</p>
    
    <p><strong>7. Pest and Disease Vigilance</strong><br>
    City pests can be relentless. Regularly inspect your plants and use organic solutions to manage issues.
    Even in the city, you can cultivate a vegetable garden that’s as productive as it is satisfying.</p>
